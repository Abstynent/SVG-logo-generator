  ## Description
  The SVG Logo Generator project aims to develop a web application that allows users to create custom logos using Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) technology. The web application will provide users with a user-friendly interface that allows them to choose from 3 pre-designed shapes: Circle, Triangle and Square. Users will be able to adjust the text and shape color.
